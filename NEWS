1.1 Removed call to composite -- speed increased by 20%, thanks to U235; added some output (number of files and skipped files)

1.0 Background color layer now downsampled; if DjVuLibre version > 3.5.32, uses FGbz chunk instead of FG44; image processing is now controlled with -p option; OCR via ocrodjvu/hocr2djvused + cuneiform is possible

0.9d Two bugs fixed: (1) lost path after minidjvu processing and (2) pgcount should decrease before breaking cycle if convert did not work

0.9c minidjvu --agression 200 for -a 2; ignoring non-graphic files

0.9b Functions cleanup

0.9a Checks for existence of folder and subfolders added, better README

0.9 Checks for ImageMagick, Djvu Libre and minidjvu (with -m option) added
