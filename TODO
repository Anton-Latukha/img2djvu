Make an option to avoid layer separation for the selected pages?

Make minidjvu accept filenames with spaces, probablly sequentially rename files immediately after conversion

Use graphicsmagick instead of imagemagick as an _option_

Mention that GNU getopt is required

Set compress options separtately for bw and color

"Poor man multithread": utility like 'img2djvupmm' which
 counts files,
 divides with excess with 't' as a result,
 adds excess to first number,
 makes t dirs,
 symlinks to the first dir maximal number of files,
 symlinks to others equal numbers of files,
 runs 'img2djvu' simultaneously on each,
 glues results
