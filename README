This is a single-pass DjVu encoder based on DjVu Libre and ImageMagick, optionally also minidjvu and ocrodjvu plus cuneiform

img2djvu is a public domain. Many thanks to members of forum.ru-board.com for ideas, suggestions and corrections, especially to U235, anagnost96 and monday2000.

Examples ("images" is a folder which contains several TIFF files):

> img2djvu -d 600 images

Will change default resolution (300 dpi) to 600 dpi

> img2djvu -t 17 images

Among color files, only files with color count < 17 will be sent to cpaldjvu DjVu coder

> img2djvu -t 0 images

Will skip ImageMagick color count (this is much faster!) and send all color files to c44 DjVu coder; cpaldjvu will not run

> img2djvu -m 10 images

For black and white pages, will employ minidjvu DjVu coder (with 10 pages per dictionary) instead of default cjb2 coder

> img2djvu -l 1 images

For color pages, will do layer separation (assuming that the file is the result of Scan Tailor mixed mode output), then blur color part and start forced segmentation; it is slow but usually produce compact output.
Scan Tailor: http://scantailor.sourceforge.net/
Layer separation after Scan Tailor: http://forum.ru-board.com/topic.cgi?forum=5&topic=32945 (in Russian)
Forced segmentation: http://djvu-soft.narod.ru/scan/back_glue.htm (in Russian)

> img2djvu -a 2 -m 20 -l 1 images

Will produce compact output; however, check the result carefully---artifacts could appear!

> img2djvu -l 2 images

Will use two-fold downsampling for color layers. This will save lots of size. Coefficient should be an integer between 1 and 12; 2, 3, or 4 are best choices.

> img2djvu -p "" images

Will NOT use blur and contrast for processing color layers

> img2djvu -l 1 -r rus -a 1 images

Will run hocr2djvused and/or ocrodjvu with cuneiform with "-rus" language option on both monochrome layers and monochrome pages and insert text layer

Caveats

It is expected that all images inside a folder have same resolution

Image names are very important; they determine the page sequence in future DjVu file. It is strongly recommended to rename files sequentially before im2djvu run

It is not expected that layer separation and forced segmentation will harm non-Scan Tailor files; moreover, its output should be smaller than c44 output even for "common" color files
